# Activity Utils changelog

## 2026-09-04

### Added
- `create_file` / `update_file` accept an optional `draftitemid` from `webservice/upload.php` and save it through Moodle's resource draft area.
- `create_assignment` / `update_assignment` accept an optional `introattachments` draft item id. Update replaces the intro attachment area when that id is set.

## 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- Quiz question removal now uses Moodle's `structure::remove_slot()` so the `slot_deleted` event includes `questionreferenceid`.

### Fixed
- Corrected PHPUnit imports for subsection/activity tests so they reference the real external API namespaces.
- Replaced manual course section sequence editing in the shared module-placement helper with Moodle's `course_add_cm_to_section()` API.
- Ensured course modules added through the helper are linked to the correct `course_sections.id` instead of relying on section numbers.
- Refactored subsection creation to use Moodle's module creation flow for `mod_subsection`, preserving the existing API response while letting Moodle create the subsection instance, course module, delegated section, events, and caches.
- Updated subsection tests to assert delegated-section metadata against the subsection instance id and parent course section id.
- Fixed quiz attempt read services so optional response fields are omitted instead of returned as `null`.
- Changed page and file update permissions to require existing-activity management rights instead of create-instance rights, and routed visibility changes through Moodle's visibility API.
- Wrapped file resource create/update operations in delegated transactions to avoid orphaned modules or missing files after partial failures.
- Wrapped subsection creation and delegated-section summary updates in one transaction.
- Wrapped book chapter add/update writes in transactions.
- Refactored page, URL, book, forum, and file creation to use Moodle's `add_moduleinfo()` lifecycle instead of direct `{course_modules}` inserts.
- Refactored assignment creation to use Moodle's `assign_add_instance()` lifecycle through `add_moduleinfo()`, preserving file-submission plugin settings and intro attachments.
- Refactored quiz creation to use Moodle's `quiz_add_instance()` lifecycle through `add_moduleinfo()`, including review bitmask conversion to Moodle's expected form-style review options.

### Known follow-up
- BigBlueButton creation still needs a dedicated `add_moduleinfo()` lifecycle refactor because it has module-specific meeting defaults.
